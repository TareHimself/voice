# voice
## This is a voice-assistant built with python.
It is meant to be extendible with plugins to allow the core assistant interface with other programs/api such as, recieving commands from telegram or speaking in discord voice channels once it recieves a command from discord. The system just described was implemented using "context based replies" where once a command/skill is activated you can pass a context that will handle replies and such for said command/skill.
